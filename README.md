Project for LehighHacks Fall 2016, placing second in OSISoft's challenge and Top 5 Overall. 

Uses Python to pull data from the PI web API, analyze it, format it in JSON, and send it to a server.

Uses C# and Unity to get the data from the server, construct a 3D environment from Google Street View Data of the relevant location, and superimpose the data.

See it in action here! (note that it is a lot less impressive when not in VR):
